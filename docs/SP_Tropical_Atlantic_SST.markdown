# Seasonal-Prediction on SST of the tropic Atlantic 

## Prediction Skills ##
>> Evaluatable skills of the tropic Atlantic
>> Based on the available observations
>> Starts with one of models involved in the CPC NMME project.
 
* __GFDL__ CFS (model version __(?)__) (24 members __(?)__)
  * Skills we are going to look at:

    * SST ![](../figures/Tropical_Atlantic_SST/CFSv2_HadISST_Corr.png)

    * Surface winds

    * ...
  * Skills that CPC uploaded. (They uploaded globle skill map and anomalies. Not clear if this is useful for accessing the skills of regional index, ex: Nino 3.4)
    * SST
    * Two meter air temperature
    * Precipitation 

    * Questions/issues of the products
      *Did they apply seasonal-average (3-month running mean) on the anomaly?
or is it purely monthly anomaly? (normally skill will be better if seasonal average is applied.)


#### thoughts ####
  * Should the energy budget be studied?
