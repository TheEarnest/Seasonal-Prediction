# Seasonal-Prediction on SST of the Tropic Atlantic 

## Prediction Skills
>> Evaluatable skills of the tropic Atlantic
>> Based on the available observations
>> Starts with one of models involved in the CPC NMME project.
 
* GFDL GFS (model version__?__) (24 members__?__)
  * Skills we are going to look at:
    * SST 
    * Surface wind
    * ...
  * Skills that CPC uploaded.
    * SST
      * Globle skill map
    * Two meter air temperature
    * Precipitation 


## thoughts
  * Should the energy budget be studied?
